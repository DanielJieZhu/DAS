<!-- das_noresults.tmpl -->
<div>
DAS queried the following services:
<ul>
#for key, val in $service_map.items()
#set system=$quote($key)
#set apis=', '.join([$quote(s) for s in val])
<li><b>$system:</b> $apis APIs
#end for
</ul>
but no results were found. You may try to use a pattern in your query to
increase a chance to find what you want, e.g.
<pre>
dataset=*RelVal*
</pre>
Please note, DAS is <b>case-sensitive</b> due to restriction in underlying
data services. Therefore <em>dataset=*RelVal*</em> is not the same as
<em>dataset=*relval*</em> DAS queries.
