DAS (or underlying services) do not support this query yet.

Still you can run multiple queries and combine their results:

$q1_str
for each result:
    $q2_str  (replace <PK> with value of $pk from first query)

Combination of the two queries will give the results expected,
except for aggregations which have to be implemented manually.
