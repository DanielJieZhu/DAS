### the outputs of this template are clear text which will be

DAS (or underlying services) do not support this query yet.

Still you can run multiple queries and combine their results:

$q1_str
for each result:
    $q2_str  (replace ${pk_to_replace} with value of $pk from first query)

Combination of the two queries will give the results expected,
except for aggregations which have to be implemented manually.
