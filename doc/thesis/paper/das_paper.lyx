\begin_layout Abstract
In the cases when there is no direct access to the data, but only certain
 interfaces are available (e.g.
 web services, web forms, proprietary systems, etc), the virtual data integratio
n provides a way to query the sources in a coherent way.
 Querying is usually done through structured query languages such as the
 SQL and 
\color red
alike
\color inherit
, allowing to obtain the precise results, but implying that the user must
 learn the query language and has to know how the data is structured.
 The keyword search is a popular way for finding information, however the

 CMS data-services should be described better.

\series default
 You need to give overview of them, e.g.
 their size/volume, back-ends, access patterns (i.e.
 # of calls, etc).
 This can also explain why CMS services where not designed originally as
 information retrieval system and rather being architectured around production
 use cases of CMS/LHC.

Motivation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At scientific collaborations such as the

, where this work has been conducted, data often resides on a fair number
 of autonomous systems each serving its own purpose
\series bold
\color red

\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
At CERN, due to many reasons (e.g.
 research-orientedness and need of freedom, politics of institutes involved)
 software projects usually evolve in independent fashion, resulting in fair
 number of proprietary systems
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Koch00CERN"

\end_inset

, whereas high turnover makes it harder to extend these systems 
\end_layout

\end_inset


\series default
\color inherit
.
 As data stored on one system may be related to data residing on the others,
 users are in need of a centralized and easy-to-use solution for locating
 and combining data from all these multiple sources.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The EII, solves the data integration problem even when data is volatile
 and systems are
\series bold
 
\series default
heterogeneous and reluctant to change, however the complexity of writing
 such queries first impacts the simple users, forcing them to learn the
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

schema
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and the query language.
 However, even the tech-savvy users may have only a vague idea of where
 exactly to find what they need.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As an another example, the web search engines, which are becoming close
 to generic question-answering

engines

\end_inset

, could employ the methods presented in this work, for providing the immediate
 answers to certain types of queries, whose results can not be pre-cached,
 but are available on the vast quantities of continuously growing public,
 corporate, or governmental data services.
 For instance, the query 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 can be interpreted as requesting the tracking information for a given TNT

DAS Query language (DASQL) and the Execution Flow
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Currently the queries are formed by specifying what entity the user is intereste
d in (dataset, file, etc) and providing selection criteria (e.g.
 attribute=value, name BETWEEN [v1, v2]).
 The combined query results could be later 'piped' for further filtering,
 sorting or aggregation (min, max, avg, sum, count, median), e.g.:

, the DAS query language corresponds to the physical execution flow over

, which feed the results from one service into inputs of the others).
 Then after retrieving the results from services, the filters and projections
 are applied, which is followed by aggregators.
 In between there could be additional operations, such as 
\emph on
unique

 for selecting only unique records, or custom map-reduce processing steps.
 This has both advantages (users are aware of service constraints) and disadvant
ages (for complex queries, users have to know how the data structured).

\begin_layout Standard
Taking inspiration from Keymantic 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, a keyword query is processed as follows (see Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:query-translation-steps"

\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Firstly, the keyword query is pre-processed by the 
\emph on

\emph default
: it is cleans up the query, identifies any explicit phrase tokens, or basic
 operators (see section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Secondly, employing a number of string matching techniques based on metadata,
 the

 This also includes identifying chunks of keywords likely corresponding
 to multi-word schema terms (curently present only as names result field).
\change_unchanged

\begin_layout Standard
Thirdly, the

Step 1: Tokenizer
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The tokenizer do not try to parse the natural language, however attempts
 to cover as many of unambiguous cases as possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the goal to simplify subsequent processing, first the keyword query
 is cleaned-up, standardizing its notation (e.g.
 removing extra spaces, normalizing date formats from YYYY-MM-DD into YYYYMMDD
 accepted by EII system, 
\color red
also recognizing some expressions in 
\color inherit
natural language, such as simple operators [X equals Y, X more than Y, etc]).
 This is accomplished using a number of regular expression replacement patterns.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then, the keyword query is tokenized into tokens of:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
strings of "terms operator value" (e.g.
 
\family typewriter
nevent > 1, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

number of events

), if any
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
phrases with compound query terms in brackets (e.g.

\family typewriter
 "number of events"
\family default
), if any
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
individual query terms, otherwise
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second task is accomplished by splitting the input string on a regular-expre
ssion matching pattern which match the three cases above (n proper order),
 but exclude white-spaces outside of the brackets.

Step 2: Identifying entry points: Entity matching

 applying the techniques below.
 To lower false positives, only the matches that score above some predefined
 cut-off threshold are included.

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Custom string similarity function
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our experience is that basic string-edit distance metrics such as the standard
 Levenshtein edit-distance (where inserts, edits, and mutations are equal)

\end_inset


\emph default
 which are initially designed for general matching tasks (e.g.
 matching people names, correcting typing errors, etc), do not perform very
 well in the task of matching keywords into specific entity names, either
 introducing too many false-positives (e.g.
 'file' as 'site'), or not recognizing lexically farther word combinations
 that still make sense, such as 
\emph on
config
\emph default
 vs 
\emph on
configuration
\emph default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore, to minimize the false positives (which have direct effect on
 ranking), we propose to use a combination of more trustful metrics in this
 order: full match, lemma match (e.g.
 only the word number differs), stem-match, stem match within a very small
 edit distance, see eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:string_dist"

\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $dist$
\end_inset

 is some string distance metric with limitations 
\color magenta
(e.g.
 max 1-3 characters differing, max 1 mutation, beginning or end preferred,
 otherwise zero).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
similarity(A,B)=\begin{cases}
1, & if\, A=B\\

As a regular expression (regexp) match do not guarantee a correct keyword
 interpretation (a regular expression could be too loose), so in general
 case, regexp matches are scored lower than in other matching methods.
 Still, some regular expressions are sufficiently restrictive (e.g.
 email), which we score higher.

, with the probabilistic approach to be more sensitive to variations in
 scoring quality of the entry points (the scores are just estimates of our
 confidence, not real probabilities; the results improved with improvements
 to accuracy of string matching functions), however it seems the second
 approach is more exact in ranking the results when the entry point scores
 are quite exact.
 The final scores of the probabilistic approach are also more complex to
 interpret the result (if we have low score for an interpretation of a keyword
 it doesn't necessarily mean it is not a good match).

 queries are complex for a machine to interpret because of their ambiguity

 Form-based interfaces has been around since many years, however with many

\begin_layout Plain Layout
there are quite a many ways of expressing operations (such as ordering,
 min, max, etc), and often these may look ambiguous, for instance a query
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\bar under
smallest file
\bar default
 in Zmmg with 100 or more events
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is asking for

the smallest file

 (order by file size), but

not

 what is smallest file size (that would be min(file.size)).

Answer type resolving could help a little (answer type: NP: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Adj: smallest N:file

), but we are still left in a quite complex situation.

Another thing which could useful for the users at CMS Experiment, CERN,
 is search system that allows a) combing keyword-based and structured search
 (even in the same query), and that b) do not require the queries to be
 in a format that depends on physical service implementation (inputs vs
 outputs), while the current 
\emph on
DAS Query Language
\emph default
 does.
