At large scientific collaborations like the CMS Experiment at CERN's LHC that includes more than 3000 collaborators data usually resides on a fair number of autonomous and heterogeneous proprietary systems each serving it's own purpose

For instance, at CERN, due to many reasons (e.g. research and need of freedom, politics of institutes involved) software projects usually evolve in independent fashion resulting in fair number of proprietary systems

. Further high turnover makes it harder extending these systems
\end_layout

. As data stored on one system may be related to data residing on other systems (for instance, datasets containing physics events are registered at DBS, while the physical location of files is tracked by Phedex which also takes care of their transfers within the worldwide grid storage), users are in need of a centralized and easy-to-use solution for locating and combining data from all these multiple services.

Using a highly structured language like SQL is problematic because users need to know not only the language but also where to find the information and also lots of technical details like schema. A system supporting simplified structured queries is already in place, while

Currently the queries specify what entity the user is interested in (dataset, file, etc) and provide selection criteria (attribute=value, name BETWEEN [v1, v2]) operators. The combined query results could be later 'pipped' for further filtering and aggregation (min, avg, etc), e.g.:

Further a specific set of minimum search predicates is imposed by APIs and user has to know that is expected to provide these.

Query Template ranking based on keyword query

 proposes alternative approach for processing keyword queries over relational databases: given a keyword query, instead of returning database tuples one could rank query forms that best matches the query for user to choose the right one (if they are properly named this is fairly easy). The ranking is done by

An interesting feature of this approach is that a Query Template is functionally similar to any autonomous web service (which given the parameters would in turn execute that query on its database). In case of the Data Aggregation System, a user after entering a keyword query could be provided with a ranked list of structured queries (attribute=value) that could be processed given data source constraints (e.g. parameters required) and if needed he could refine his search (e.g. provide more parameters).
