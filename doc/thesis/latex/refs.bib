        abstract = {We witness a rapid increase in the number of structured information sources that are available online, especially on the WWW. These sources include commercial databases on product information, stock market information, real estate, automobiles, and entertainment. We would like to use the data stored in these databases to answer complex queries that go beyond keyword searches. We face the following challenges: (1) Several information sources store interrelated data, and any query-answering system must understand the relationships between their contents. (2) Many sources are not full-featured database systems and can answer only a small set of queries over their data (for example, forms on the WWW restrict the set of queries one can (3) Since the number of sources is very large, effective techniques are needed to prune the set of information sources accessed to answer a query. (4) The details of interacting with each source vary greatly. We describe the Information Manifold, an implemented system that provides uniform access to a heterogeneous collection of more than 100 information sources, many of them on the WWW. IM tackles the above problems by providing a mechanism to describe declaratively the contents and query capabilities of available information sources. There is a clean separation between the declarative source description and the actual details of interacting with an information source. We describe algorithms that use the source descriptions to prune effciently the set of information sources for a given query and practical algorithms to generate executable query plans. The query plans we generate can inolve querying several information sources and combining their answers. We also present experimental studies that indicate that the architecture and algorithms used in the Information Manifold scale up well to several hundred information sources}

abstract = "Meta-data plays a significant role in large modern enterprises, research experiments and digital libraries where it comes from many different sources and is distributed in a variety of digital formats. It is organized and managed by constantly evolving software using both relational and non-relational data sources. Even though we can apply an information retrieval approach to non-relational data sources, we canâ€™t do so for relational ones, where information is accessed via a pre-established set of data-services.

Here we discuss a new data aggregation system which consumes, indexes and delivers information from different relational and non-relational data sources to answer cross data-service queries and explore meta-data associated with petabytes of experimental data. We combine the simplicity of keyword-based search with the precision of RDMS under the new system. The aggregated information is collected from various sources, allowing end-users to place dynamic queries, get precise answers and trigger information retrieval on demand. Based on the use cases of the CMS experiment, we have performed a set of detailed, large scale tests the results of which we present in this paper."

  abstract={We present the Data Aggregation System, a system for information retrieval and aggregation from heterogenous sources of relational and non-relational data for the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment on the CERN Large Hadron Collider. The experiment currently has a number of organically-developed data sources, including front-ends to a number of different relational databases and non-database data services which do not share common data structures or APIs ( Application Programming Interfaces ), and cannot at this stage be readily converged. DAS provides a single interface for querying all these services, a caching layer to speed up access to expensive underlying calls and the ability to merge records from different data services pertaining to a single primary key.}

  abstract={The CMS Dataset Bookkeeping System (DBS) search page is a web-based application used by physicists and production managers to find data from the CMS experiment. The main challenge in the design of the system was to map the complex, distributed data model embodied in the DBS and the Data Location Service (DLS) to a simple, intuitive interface consistent with the mental model of physicists analyzing the data. We used focus groups and user interviews to establish the required features. The resulting interface addresses the physicist and production manager roles separately, offering both a guided search structured for the common physics use cases as well as a dynamic advanced query interface.}

While this phenomenon is creating an opportunity for structured data management, dealing with heterogeneity on the web-scale presents many new challenges. In this paper, we highlight these challenges in two scenarios – the Deep Web and Google Base. We contend that traditional data integration techniques are no longer valid in the face of such heterogeneity and scale. We propose a new data integration architecture, PAYGO, which is inspired by the concept of dataspaces and emphasizes pay-as-you-go data management as means for achieving web-scale data integration. 1.},
