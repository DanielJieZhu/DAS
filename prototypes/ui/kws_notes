kwd mapped into: (with different weights)
    - entity name
    - selection attribute value (das key)
        also each provider may have it's own naming
        
    - selection attribute name (e.g. file=str next)
        dataset file /EG/Run2010A*/AOD
        
        
        
    - show which selection keys are still missing due to provider's limitations        
        -> can we try to build a complex query? however it could be quite too less defined
    
    
    --> could in theory evaluate even all posibilities however this is too loose. One thing we MUST restrict is the entitty they search
    
    Your query can not be answered unambigously. Please specify more details:
    
    which entity you are searching for?                 what do you know about the data?
        dataset                                         run=XXX
        run 
        .... etc
    
    
    sample use-cases:
        run 2011 (very ambg)   ; run *2011* (better)     ==>     run dataset=/*/*2011*/*/*    
        run /Cosmic*         ==>                 run dataset=/Cosmic*       (clear dataset pattern; even can't be file)
        dataset file=/store/data/BeamCommissioning09/*
        dataset file=/EG/Run2010A*/AOD
        
        
        PRODUCTION /WbbToLNu_TuneZ2_7TeV-madgraph-pythia6-tauola/Summer11-START311_V2-*         
        ===> dataset status=PRODUCTION dataset=/WbbToLNu_TuneZ2_7TeV-madgraph-pythia6-tauola/Summer11-START311_V2-*
        
        (?dataset) CMSSW_4_4_0_pre10 RelValTTbar *-RECO *MC_43_V4-v1*
        entity could be implied by most matching values (in this cases this is quite selective/informative
            CMSSW_4_4_0_pre10 RelValTTbar *-RECO *MC_43_V4-v1*
            ==> dataset release=CMSSW_4_4_0_pre10 primary_dataset=RelValTTbar tier=*-RECO dataset=*MC_43_V4-v1*        
        
        
        
        combination of KWS and key=val search !!
            file run BETWEEN [176000, 175830] /StreamExpress/Run2011B-TkAlMinB*/ALCARECO
            file run=166408 /MuOnia/Run2011*-PromptReco-v1/RECO
               ( worse) file 166408 /MuOnia/Run2011*-PromptReco-v1/RECO
        
        
        dataset site=T2_EE_Estonia*
            -- however here we'll ask user to provide more info as no API could answer this directly!
            -- or we could form a complex query ... --> see below
            
        release /HT/Run2012*
        
    two possible UI versions:
        rank combinations as a list
        
        rank options for each keyword  (ranked drop downs  ? )
        
    
    
    
    
    entity patterns:
        release: CMSSW_.*_...                   
        dataset: O(100K),  /.*/.*/.* (or less restricted *something* *a*b*c etc) 
        tier: limited number of values of O(45), but could have a wildcard pattern (*-RECO)
        primary_dataset: less than dataset?
    
    
Good Autocompletion is very very important:
    e.g. site, tier.  release, primary ds, dataset?
        
Complex queries:
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
    sample use-cases:
        (e.g. no service could answer fully, for these cases we have currently manually defined wrappers that are supposed to compbine the results, but they fail often)
        dataset site=T2_EE_Estonia*
            
                here we get couple of options:
